/** @brief Manage the FMC CDU display.
 *
 * 	This is singleton class that manages the screen of the FMC CDU.
 *
 * 	It uses SDL2 to render the display.
 *
 * 	The class is used by calling submit* methods, which queue activities
 * 	to be rendered a screen handling thread. This ensures that only one
 * 	thread is making SDL2 calls at a time.
 *
 * 	The class managed a single texture (screenBufferTexture) that holds
 * 	the current display. All drawing is done onto this texture, which
 * 	is then rendered to the display in its entirety.
 *
 * 	The screen uses truetype fonts, however for performance reasons, it
 * 	pre-caches the characters used by the FMC into a texture. Whenever a
 * 	character needs to drawn, a single character is copied to the
 * 	appropriate position on the screenBufferTexture.
